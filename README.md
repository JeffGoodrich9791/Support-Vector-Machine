## Support Vector Machine Model Evaluation 
### Predicting Buying Habits with Social Media Advertisement Data

### Install

This project requires **Python 2.7** or above and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

In order to complete this project you will need the software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

I used the platform [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python platform that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project. 

### Code

Template code is provided in the `Support_Vector_Machine.ipynb` notebook file. You will also be required to use the included `visuals.py` Python file and the `Social_Network_Ads.csv` dataset file to complete your work. While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality when requested to successfully complete the project.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `boston_housing/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```ipython notebook Logistic Support_Vector_Machine.ipynb```  
```jupyter notebook Logistic Support_Vector_Machine.ipynb```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.

### Results

Support Vector Machine with a non-linear "rbf" kernel produced a prediction accuracy of 93% on 100 training examples
